But no doubt fantastic, through and through. But, first, let’s get you introduced to yourself.\n\nYou’re twelve, and no one takes you seriously. You really like chewing bubble gum and you’ve got a terrible habit of sticking it under any surface you’re near. Your mother has to go to the chiropractor to get her back adjusted because she is so often hunched over, scraping your chewed bubble gum off the furniture.\n\nIf you had any friends, no doubt the undersides of their furniture would be covered by the time you left. But I assure you, it’s not the gum that causes you to have no friends, though you sternly refuse to share a piece with anyone who asks, it’s that you’re rude and careless. With people, with objects, with money—and especially objects and money that aren’t yours, which is basically everything because, again, you’re twelve.\n\nWhen you open your eyes, lying in bed, the mid-afternoon sun streaming in through your bedroom window, making your hair mat itself to your forehead in a way that feels disgusting, you hear a faint breathing at your door. You find your mother standing there, white knuckles wrapped around a telephone receiver.\n\n“What did you do this time? My beautiful, horrible child!” Her face contorts as she shrieks.\n\nYou shrug.\n\n“The mayor just called. He said he needs you to slay a dragon. Do you know anything about that? How would you know anything about that! You’re just a child. A beautiful, horrible child, but just a child at that. Do you have any idea what I am saying to you right now?”\n\nYou stare at her and try to muster an expression but nothing really comes to you, so you just shrug again.\n\nFor a second your mother’s face becomes very red and you think her eyes might pop out of her head and there’s a faint creaking sound coming from her mouth like glass being ground between stone. But then she blinks a few times and everything seems to be just dandy.\n\n“Okay, well the mayor would like to see you urgently. Please get dressed and then we’ll be off. Please be sure to wear something nice for the Mayor.”",
